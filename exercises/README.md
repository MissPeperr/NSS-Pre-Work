# JavaScript Exercises
Students will not be using Visual Studio Code at this point. We will need to guide them on using an online text editor. I've mentioned that [Repl.it](https://repl.it) and [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) are good (enough), if there is a specific online text-editor you'd like to use, feel free to use it!

All of the answers to the exercises are located in the [Answers](./answers) directory.
