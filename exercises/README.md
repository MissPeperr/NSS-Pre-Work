# JavaScript Exercises
Students will not be using Visual Studio Code at this point. We will need to guide them on using an online text editor. I've mentioned that [Repl.it](https://repl.it) and [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) are good (enough), if there is a specific online text-editor you'd like to use, feel free to use it! You can send out the exercise via slack and they'll copy it to whatever online text editor you're using.

All of the answers to the exercises are located in the [Answers](./answers) directory.
