// 1. Instantiate and assign a variable called movieArray. This variable should hold an array of your favorite movie titles. (Don't go overboard- two or three is fine).


// 2. Log each movie in the array to the console.


// 3. Add a movie into the array. (HINT: .push() it into the array!)


// 4. Log the newly added movie to the console

// SUPER MEGA CHALLENGE //
// 5. Write a for loop to loop over the movieArray and console.log each movie!
