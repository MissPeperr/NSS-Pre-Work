///// VARIABLES & CONCATENATION /////
// Let's make a sandwich!
// How about a sandwich with ham, swiss cheese, and mustard?
// We'll make 3 variables; 1 for each topping on the sandwich.


// Now concatenate these ingredients, and print them to the console!

// Example: "I would like a ____ and ____ cheese sandwich, with ____ please!"



///// FUNCTIONS /////
// Now I wanna make lots of sandwiches! But what if I want to use different ingredients, to make different sandwiches?
// This is a perfect time to use a function!
// With a function, I'll be able to create LOTS of sandwiches, without concatenating over and over again.

// We'll start off by making our variables for meat, cheese, vegetable, and a condiment


// Now declare the function "makeSandwich" that has the parameters for all of our ingredients
// The function should produce our concatenated sandwich!
// The parameters are what we want to use inside of our function, everything inside of the {}s is what we want our function to produce.


// What else can we make with functions?

// Make a function called carFactory, with parameters of model, make, and color
// The function should return a completed car, and log it to the console
