    Let's make a sandwich!
    How about a sandwich with ham, swiss cheese, and mustard?
    We'll make 3 variables; 1 for each topping on the sandwich.
*/


// Now concatenate these ingredients, and print them to the console!
// Example: "I would like a ____ and ____ cheese sandwich, with ____ please!"



///// FUNCTIONS /////
/*
    Now I want to make a lot of sandwiches! This is a perfect time to use a function! With a function, I'll be able to create LOTS of ham & cheese sandwiches, without concatenating over and over again.
    Let's declare a function called "makeHamNCheese" that console.logs "I would like a ham and swiss cheese sandwich, with mustard please!", using our variables that we've already created.
*/



/*
    But what if I want to use different ingredients, to make different sandwiches?
    Now we'll have to tell our function what it needs in order to create many different kinds of sandwiches. We can use the parameters inside of the ()'s to decide what ingredients will go in this sandwich.
*/
// Let's create some more variables to store a meat, cheese, veggie, and condiment



// Now declare the function "makeSandwich" that has the parameters for all of our ingredients
/*
    The function should produce our concatenated sandwich!
    The parameters are what we want to use inside of our function, everything inside of the {}s is what we want our function to produce.
*/


// Call the function and pass in our ingredients:


///// RETURNS /////
/*
    We've made functions that DO things, now let's make a function that RETURNS something back to us. Our sandwich functions did one thing and one thing only: make a sandwich. Now let's have it make a sandwich AND give it back to us!
    When we use a return statement, we're asking the function to perform its action and give us back the result. Now we're telling the function to do it and WE'LL do something with the result that it gives back.
*/
// Let's create a function called makePizza -- The function should reutrn a string of our completed pizza
// Example: "Here's your pepperoni and cheese pizza!"


// Call the function. Did you see it in the console?


/*
    We'll need to either store our pizza in a variable, or console.log the the whole function!
*/
// For now we'll store it in a variable to eat later:


// Now console.log the variable that has our pizza!
