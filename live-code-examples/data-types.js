/// ARRAYS ///

// Use bracket notation to access the first food in the array

// Insert a new food item into the array with .push()

// Find out how many items are in the array with .length

// Turn your array into a stringified list with .join()
// Hint: you might need to put something inside the parentheses for .join





///// PART TWO /////
/// OBJECTS & LOOPS ///

// 8. Take a second to digest the following object:
var theRock = {
    firstName: "Dwayne",
    nickName: "The Rock",
    lastName: "Johnson",
    favoriteFoods: ["Raw Meat", "Ambition"],
    hobbies: ["Jumping out of Planes", "Wrestling Grizzlies", "Personally Holding the San Andreas Fault Together", "Crashing Through Walls"],
    pets: {
      dog: "Hobbs",
      cat: "Calvin"
    }
  }

  // Now use this object to:

  // 9. Print Dwayne The Rock Johnson's first name to the console.

  // 10. Print Dwayne The Rock Johnson's dog's name to the console

  // 11. Print the first item in The Rock's hobby array to the console

  // 12. Add a property of 'motto' to The Rock's object and set it equal to a personal motto that you make up

  // 13. Create an object that represents some fun facts about yourself, using Dwayne The Rock Johnson as an example.


  /// LOOPS ///

  // Create an array of your favorite foods

  // Loop through the array and print each food to the console

  // Add an if/else statement to the loop. If the current food is "taco", log "WOOHOO! TACOS!" to the console. If not, log "but have you considered tacos?"

  // From the object example above, loop through Dwayne the Rock Johnson's hobbies
