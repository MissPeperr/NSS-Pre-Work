# JavaScript Live-Code Sessions
#### Things that we need to keep in mind while we're live coding:

- These are **incoming** students! Don't assume that they know what you're talking about.
- Try to refrain from using too many technical terms. (Ex: If they would have to google it to understand what you're saying).

    > Try to keep it as basic as possible!

- We do encourage the use of `var` at this stage. Right now, it's the easiest for them to be able to do the "simple" things in JavaScript. `let` and `const`
 would cause unnecessary confusion, but will be introduced later in the Foundations course and in the course itself.
- Not every student is going through the Foundations Pre-Work at the same pace.
- Not every student might have gone over or completed the part of the Foundations Pre-Work course that we're live-coding that evening. (And that's okay!)
- Let them ask as many questions as they'd like, (and encourage them to do so)! ðŸ˜Š
