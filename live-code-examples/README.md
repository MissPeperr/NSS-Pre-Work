# JavaScript Live-Code Sessions
#### Things that we need to keep in mind while we're live coding:

- These are **incoming** students! Don't assume that they know what you're talking about.
- Try to refrain from using too many technical terms. (Ex: If they would have to google it to understand what you're saying).

    > Try to keep it as basic as possible!

- Careful about using template literals, you may need to explain what they are to students before using them.
- We're using the `function` keyword to declare functions.
- Not every student is going through the Foundations Prework at the same pace.
- Not every student might have gone over or completed the part of the Foundations Pre-Work course that we're live-coding that evening.
- Let them ask as many questions as they'd like, (and encourage them to do so)! ğŸ˜Š

## Live-Code Examples

If you're looking for exercises, head on over to the [Exercises](../exercises/) directory to find the corresponding exercise to the live-code.

- [Data Types](./data-types.js)
    > General overview of variables, strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and loops

- [Arrays](./arrays.js)

    > Dive a little deeper into arrays. (Has a lightning exercise)

- [Objects](./objects.js)

    > Create objects with various different data-types, using dot notation, and creating and assigning new properties on an object.

- [Functions](./functions.js)

    > Introduce functions by building sandwiches! Declaring functions, using parameters, and return statements.

- [Intro to the DOM](./Intro-To-DOM/)

    > Introduce the DOM using `.querySelector` or `.getElementById`, `.createElement`, `.innerHTML` or `.textContent`, and `.appendChild`.

- [Event Listenters](./Event-Listeners/)

    > Introduce event listeners using inputs and click events.
