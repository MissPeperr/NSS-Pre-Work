// INTRODUCTORY EXERCISES

// 1. Use document.querySelector to grab a reference to the div with an id of "name" (and store it in a variable!)

// 2. Use the innerHTML property to print your name into the container div! You should see your name in the DOM.

// 3. Use document.createElement to create a new div elelemt and store it in a variable

// 4. Use the innerHTML property to print your favorite food into the div you just created. You shouldn't see it in the DOM yet- that's okay!

// 5. Use appendChild to append your new favorite food div to the div with an id of "name". Now you should see your favorite food in the DOM, right below the name!

// 6. If you finish with these exercises early, try using document.createElement to create things other than divs. Can you create an H1 tag? How about a paragraph? Try setting their innerHTML the same way!


// CHALLENGE EXERCISES

// Loop over the following array:
var muppets = ["Fozzie Bear", "Kermit the Frog", "Ms. Piggy"]

// For each item in the array, create a new <li> element and append it to the <ul> element with the id of "container"



// BONUS CHALLENGE:
// Use JavaScript to create a resume for Fozzie Bear.
