# Nashville Software School Pre-Work Sessions

## Why do we have them?
Incoming students are given pre-work to get started on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as help jump-start their problem solving capabilities.
We run the pre-work sessions so students can get in-person help and in-person "instruction"! The students usually come hang out at the sessions just to work on the pre-work or listen and participate in the instruction.

These sessions are optional to incoming students and they're free to come and go as they please. We're serving as a resource for them as they are working through the pre-work, if they choose to take advantage of this resource.

## What does a pre-work session look like?

Typically we ask the students the day before what they would like to cover at the session via Slack. If there's nothing specifically they want to cover, there is a scheduled live-code review for that week.

A session starts with introducing yourself (and if you're an alumni, let them know! ðŸ˜Š). You may ask them again if there's anything specific they'd like to cover and if what they want to cover is okay with everyone else that's present. Or you can live-code the intended subject for the session.

After the subject has been decided, head to the [Live Code Examples](./live-code-examples) and find the corresponding example to live-code! It's important that students get this in-person instruction from us, so as long as you're live-coding *something* the students will appreciate it. The goal is to teach a little, then give them an exercise, teach some more, give another exercise, etc.
